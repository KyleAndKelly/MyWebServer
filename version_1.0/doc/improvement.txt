1. 指针可以改成shared_ptr，不需要delete。
2. 想法在某些地方写成单例模式。
3. readn 和 writen 改成写到不能写后或读到不能读后加入epoll等待，要记录写到哪或读到哪，维护这样一个状态。比较两者的性能差异。
4. 信号处理部分可以将 epoll_wait 替换为更安全的 epoll_pwait。


踩坑：
1. 对EPOLLONESHOT的误解，原以为当epoll_wait监听到相应的事件触发后，epoll会把与事件关联的fd从epoll描述符中禁止掉并且彻底删除，实际上并不会删除，man手册上的解释如下：
EPOLLONESHOT (since Linux 2.6.2)
              Sets the one-shot behavior for the associated file descriptor.
              This means that after an event is pulled out with
              epoll_wait(2) the associated file descriptor is internally
              disabled and no other events will be reported by the epoll
              interface.  The user must call epoll_ctl() with EPOLL_CTL_MOD
              to rearm the file descriptor with a new event mask.
另外：
Linux Programmer's Manual 中第六个问题：
        Q6  Will closing a file descriptor cause it to be removed from all
           epoll sets automatically?

        A6  Yes, but be aware of the following point.  A file descriptor is a
           reference to an open file description (see open(2)).  Whenever a
           file descriptor is duplicated via dup(2), dup2(2), fcntl(2)
           F_DUPFD, or fork(2), a new file descriptor referring to the same
           open file description is created.  An open file description con‐
           tinues to exist until all file descriptors referring to it have
           been closed.  A file descriptor is removed from an epoll set only
           after all the file descriptors referring to the underlying open
           file description have been closed (or before if the file descrip‐
           tor is explicitly removed using epoll_ctl(2) EPOLL_CTL_DEL).
           This means that even after a file descriptor that is part of an
           epoll set has been closed, events may be reported for that file
           descriptor if other file descriptors referring to the same under‐
           lying file description remain open.

当调用close()关闭对应的fd时，会使相应的引用计数减一，只有减到0时，epoll才会真的删掉它，所以，比较安全的做法是：
先del掉它，再close它(如果不确定close是否真的关闭了这个文件。)。

vim /etc/ld.so.conf
加一行include /usr/local/opencv/*
